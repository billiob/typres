typres is a presentation tool for my talk on terminology at the efl dev day
2013.

It's written in bash and runs on terminology. It uses terminology escape codes
to inline images into the terminal. Learn more about them from terminology's
README.

To view it, run typres.sh in its directory in terminology and enjoy :)

The code is under the WTF Public License. I do not own the gif files used.
